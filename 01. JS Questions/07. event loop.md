## EVENT LOOP

1. The event loop is a single-threaded loop that monitors the call stack and checks if there is any work to be done in the task queue or job queue.
2. If the call stack is empty and there are callback functions in the task queue or job queue, a function is dequeued and pushed onto the call stack to be executed.
3. MacroTasks are called Tasks, and MicroTasks are called Jobs.

- macrotasks(task) : setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, I/O tasks, etc.
- Microtasks(job) : Promises, processes.nextTick, etc.

4. At any point in time, if both the queues got entries, JobQueue gets higher precedence than TaskQueue.

```js
const tom = () => console.log('Tom');

const jerry = () => console.log('Jerry');

const cartoon = () => {
  console.log('Cartoon');

  setTimeout(tom, 5000);

  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    resolve('should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?')
  ).then((resolve) => console.log(resolve));

  jerry();
};

cartoon();
```

```js
Cartoon
Jerry
should it be right after Tom, before Jerry?
Tom
```

- The function cartoon gets into the Call Stack.
- execute the console log. (Cartoon)
- function tom gets placed into TaskQueue.
- allback of a promise gets a place in JobQueue.
- the function jerry is pushed into the Stack and executed. (Jerry)
- We have one entry in TaskQueue and one in JobQueue. The Event Loop Model prioritizes all the Jobs in JobQueue over anything in TaskQueue. Hence the callback of the promise get to the Call Stack first, gets executed, and then the function tom gets to the Call Stack from TaskQueue and gets executed.
